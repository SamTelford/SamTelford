      <h2>Planck Mechanical Keyboard</h2>
      <p>In the summer of 2015 I heard about the Planck Mechanical Keyboard for the first time. Created by Jack Humbert, the Planck is a DIY keyboard kit.
         What you see in the picture doesn't look like a regular keyboard though, and that's because the Planck differs from most keyboards in a few (pardon the pun) key ways:
         <ul>
               <li>The Planck has mechanical key switches. Gateron Browns to be specific. The key switch is the part of a keyboard that allows a key to move up and down.
                   The majority of keyboards have cheaper membrane switches, while mechanical switches are generally regarded as higher quality, longer lasting, and nicer to type on.
                   Mechanical switches come in variants that feel and/or sound different when pressed. More information about that <a href='https://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/'>here</a></li>
               <li>The Planck is ortholinear. That means the keys are lined up in both rows and columns. Most keyboards use a staggered layout to match the typewriters they were based on.</li>
               <li>My Planck is Legendless. Legends are the letters, numbers and other symbols on keycaps. I outfitted my Planck with blank keycaps to help me learn to touch type.
                   Blanks also don't show signs of wear very quickly, because they don't have symbols that can wear off.</li>
               <li>The Planck is a 40% keyboard. A full size (~108 key) keyboard is known as a 100% while a keyboard without a numberpad is a ten-keyless or 80%.
                   There are also 60% keyboards that omit dedicated arrow keys, the print screen and page up and down buttons. The planck drops the number row from the 60% form factor leaving it with only 47 keys.
                   How do you type any numbers then? The Planck has function keys that change the rest of the keyboard when held down. Just like the shift key turns z into Z, the ↓ key turns y into 9.</li>
               <li>My Planck is in Colemak. Colemak is a different arrangement of the letters from the standard Qwerty layout that was designed to be more efficient for typing in english.
                   The Qwerty layout (like the staggered layout) is a relic from typewriter that kept frequently used letters spread out to reduce jamming.
                   Colemak puts common letters like E, N, T, and S on the home row where they are most easily reached. Colemak is also easier to switch to from Qwerty, as it keeps shortcut key for undo, cut, copy, paste and quit in the same place.</li>
         </ul>
